# Springboard Data Science Capstone 1 - Do Review Scores influence Video Game Sales?
Recently, we saw more and more news articles discussing the impact of internet review scores on the sales of video games like [this one]( https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/metacritic-scores-game-sales-gdc-2015/)  We have also seen reports like ['Former IGN employee admits review scores are skewed due to public relations'](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/former-ign-employee-admits-review-scores-are-skewed-due-to-public-relations/). It seems that review scores really matter to the video sales from these news articles...and some video game publishers really believe that to go extra miles to influence the critic review scores.

However, I want to use my data science skills and an [awesome dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings/) from kaggle by Rush Kirubi that includes game sales and their review scores scraped from Metacritic to see if Internet video games scores really have some kind of impact on game sales.
